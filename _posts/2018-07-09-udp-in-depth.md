UDP
---

UDP is a simple message-based protocol defined in [RFC768][1], originally designed on top of IPv4.
[RFC2460][2] ([RFC8200][3] for latest version) section 8.1 provides necessary modification for UDP over IPv6.

### What is defined:
-   __header format__:
    each datagram will contains four fields in header: src port, dest port, data length, checksum.
-   __number of ports can be used__:
    The src/dest port in header is a 2-byte integer, which means there are 65536 ports can be used
    on a single IP address. This is not shared with TCP.
-   __max length of a datagram__:
    The length field in header is a 2-byte integer, which represents the total length of the
    datagram (including header). In this case, the maximum data can be send in one datagram
    is `65535-8` bytes.
-   __chechsum algorithm__:
    a pseudo header is added to protect misrouted datagrams: src addr, dest addr,
    UDP protocol number, UDP length. Datagram will be discard if checksum validation failed, except
    if `0x0000` is specified in checksum field. `0x1111` is used if the computed checksum is `0x0000`.
    However, IPv6 doesn't allow turning off checksum validation (defined by [RFC6935][4]).
    Datagrams with checksum `0x0000` will be discard. [RFC6936][5] provides the applicabity of enabling
    UDP zero checksum on IPv6.

### What is not defined:
-   __connection-less__:
    Doesn't define connection establishment procedure, thus no multiplexing.
    Endpoint can send datagrams to designated remote IP/port directly.
-   __state-less__:
    Doesn't define any state and event handling procedure like in TCP.
-   __receiving order is not guaranteed__:
    Doesn't define sequence number in datagram. Datagram can arrived at receiver in any order.
-   __message delivery is not guaranteed__:
    Doesn't define message acknowledge procedure. Both sender and receiver will not know if there
    is a datagram dropped on the routing path.  ICMP error might be received by sender but the
    information will not propagate to UDP layer.
-   __no flow/congestion control__:
    Doesn't define flow control / congestion control algorithm.
    Receiver and routers on the path will simply discard the datagram it cannot handle.
-   __no encryption__:
    Doesn't define data encryption mechanism.
    The message in the datagram is clear text.

UDP-Lite
--------

UDP uses the entire datagram to calculate checksum and the datagram will be discard if validation failed.
For UDP tunneling usecase, the tunneling protocol might defined their own data correction mechanism.
Discarding the entire datagram will cancel the correction mechanism. Therefore, UDP-Lite ([RFC3828][6]) is
introduced to allow application-specified data range for computing checksum.

In POSIX Socket API, UDP-Lite socket can be create by specifying the [UDPLite][7] protocol id.
The checksum data range is controlled via socket option `UDPLITE_SEND_CSCOV` and `UDPLITE_RECV_CSCOV`.

    sockfd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM, IPPROTO_UDPLITE);


SCTP
----
SCTP ([RFC2960][8]) is a message-oriented transport protocol which supports reliable, in-sequence delivery with congestion control like TCP. The design goal is to transmit signaling message reliablely.
SCTP also defined message framing format so that application protocols doesn't need to define a token of message boundary like while using TCP.
SCTP-UDP ([RFC6951][9]) defines a mechanism to run SCTP over UDP.
In current draft of WebRTC DataChannel ([RTCWEB-DATA][13]) it leverage SCTP in the protocol stack to provide reliable 

### features:
-   __reliable connection setup/teardown__:
    4-way handshake is used to createa an association between two endpoints (a logical connection).
-   __no head-of-line blocking__:
    Support multiple data stream in one association. Message order is guaranteed inside a stream.
    application data sent on a stream is divided into chucks, which allows interleaving chuncks on
    different stream during transmission.
-   __fregmentation in transport layer__:
    Message is divided into chucks that can fit with the smallest size of MTU of all paths, to prevent IP fregmentation.
-   __TCP-like flow control/congestion control__:
    Use `rwnd` (receiver window size) to do flow control, `cwnd` (congestion window size) and slow start to do congestion control.
-   __support Explicit Congestion Notification__:
-   __support multi-homing__
    SCTP association can have multiple IP address.
    SCTP will use alternative path for transmitting while failed to use the primary path
-   __support configurable reliability__:
    Partially Reliable Stream Control Transmission Protocol extension ([PR-SCTP][12]) provides a mechanism to limit the number of retransmission.

DCCP
----

DCCP ([RFC4340][10]) is another message-oriented transport protocol, which supports congestion control.
Unlike SCTP, delivery order is not guaranteed. The design goal is to support streaming data, i.e. optimized
for latency over reliability. This protocol can also be used on top of UDP in order to provide general
congestion contorl ([DCCP-UDP][11]) to application layer.

### features:
-   __reliable connection setup/teardown__
-   __negociation for congestion control mechanism__
-   __support Explicit Congestion Notification__
-   __support partial checksum like UDP-Lite__

DTLS
----

DTLS ([RFC4347][14] for 1.0, [RFC6347][15] for 1.2) provides encrypted communication for datagram protocol.
It is based on TLS with necessary modification in order to run on unreliable transport channel (e.g. UDP).
It defines two layers: Record layer for fregmentation, encryption, and compression; Handshake layer for exchanging encryption parameters.
Fragmentation and retrasmission timer is used solely for handshake message, no explicit flow control / congestion control on DTLS channel.

### differences to TLS:
-   __no stream cipher__:
    Stream cipher cannot decipher if data lost in the middle of cipher text, therefore these cipher algorithms are disallowed in DTLS.
-   __cookie exchange__:
    A stateless cookie exchange is added to prevent DoS attack (similar design as SCTP). The cookie is the HMAC of IP and parameters of received `ClientHello`, generated by server. Client need to send the same `ClientHello` again with cookie attached.
-   __explicit sequence number and epoch__:
    Unlike TLS, the sequence number of DTLS Record is not encrypted to detect reordered message. `epoch` is increased each time when cipher state is changed (i.e. `ChangeCipherSpec` is sent). Endpoint should discard messages with epoch less than current one. Sequence number is reset to 0 every time `epoch` is changed.
-   __fregment handshake message__:
    Large handshake message will be splited into multiple records that is smaller than PMTU. Sender will retransmit entire message if no response is received before timeout.
